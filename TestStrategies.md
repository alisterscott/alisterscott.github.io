# Testing Strategies

### Agile Testing QA Manifesto

1.  Testing throughout over testing at the end
2.  Preventing bugs over finding bugs
3.  Testing understanding over testing functionality
4.  Building the best system over breaking the system
5.  Team responsibility over tester responsibility

### The Modern Testing Mission Statement

_Accelerate the Achievement of Shippable Quality_

### The Modern Testing Principles

The seven principles of Modern Testing are:

1.  Our priority is improving the business.
2.  We accelerate the team, and use models like Lean Thinking and the Theory of Constraints to help identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.
3.  We are a force for continuous improvement, helping the team adapt and optimize in order to succeed, rather than providing a safety net to catch failures.
4.  We care deeply about the quality culture of our team, and we coach, lead, and nurture the team towards a more mature quality culture.
5.  We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product
6.  We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and then close the gaps between product hypotheses and business impact.
7.  We expand testing abilities and knowhow across the team; understanding that this may reduce (or eliminate) the need for a dedicated testing specialist.
