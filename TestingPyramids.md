title:  Testing Pyramids & Ice-Cream Cones
---

I like using the software testing pyramid as a visual way to represent where you should be focusing your testing effort, and often switch between using a cloud or an [Eye of Providence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Providence) to represent human manual exploratory testing at the top of the pyramid that you should use to supplement and test your automated tests.

I often see organizations fall into the trap of creating 'inverted' pyramids of software testing -- the best pyramid to invert is the cloud one since it becomes the **the software testing ice-cream cone** (anti-pattern)
